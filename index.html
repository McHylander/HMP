		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p style="text-indent: 6%;">My name is Hayley McLeod and I have a passion for Photography! A little bit about my past... I grew up in Port Coquitlam BC with my family of 4, plus my beautiful dog, a chocolate lab named Daisy. I’ve played several sports at a young age.  My favourite sport was soccer at which I played until the age of 16. I think of myself as an artistic person who loves to discover new ideas and resources. In my spare time, I love to relax with a show/movie while painting and/or drawing, baking or just having some me time.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 6%;">When it comes to Photography, I am very focused and determined with my work. I love learning new techniques and different angles to turn the camera to make a unique shot in the end. It was about 3 years ago was when I really started to have interest in Photography. I remember one day, I saw an empty street with no parked cars, no people walking along the sidewalk and a clear blue sky. I walked right into the middle of the street, leaned down close to the ground, and angled the shot perfectly to capture my photo. When I looked at the photo, I was shocked of how it turned out. I did a few edits here and there, but my final result was good! I showed it to my family and friends who gave me a lot of positive feedback! This gave me the confidence to continue on with taking photos!</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 6%;">I made a photography Instagram account with has many of my photo creations. I’ve taken Photography classes in the 11th and 12th grade and enjoyed them a lot! I hope to continue and learn more about having a career in photography.</p>

			<h2>My Mentor</h2>
			<p style="text-indent: 6%;">My mentor is named Katheryn Mussallem and she is a Photography Professor at Emily Carr University. It is 2021 and we are
			still in a pandemic, this interview was taken in a ZOOM call. I was with a group of three girls, we all had similar topics, but they were all different. Between the four of us, we had the option to ask two questions to Katheryn that was about our topics.</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>
					For being a professor at Emily Carr University, what are the most difficult and rewarding parts of being a photographer/work in photography?<br><br>

					Katheryn’s reply was, “Finding work in Vancouver is hard because it isn’t a big city (bigger in Toronto). Rewarding, she does something she loves, and she went to school for it. She had really good grades because her parents encouraged it.  She hated it because she always waited to be an artist. She went traveling around Europe one year, she got accepted into Emily Carr and came back home!”<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					For the program in Emily Carr that includes Photography and Film/TV, it’s a 4-year program with the first year being
					a foundations year that includes film and photography, and then it splits off into separate programs for the last 3
					years. Do you have any insight on this 4-year program? I’m really interested in applying because it has everything that
					I am wanting to do for my future!<br><br>
					What Katheryn told me was the first year in the four-year program (foundations year), is really a way to figure out what
					you want to do in the next three years. She did the foundations year and loved it! She met several good friends and
					learned so much to know what she wanted to do for her future career.

			<h2>My Tips & Tricks</h2>
			<p style="text-indent: 6%;">There are several tips and tricks for beginner photographers, and experienced photographers! Instead of doing a whole paragraph of the different tips/tricks, I’m going to make a numbered list!</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li><h3>Use the Rule of Thirds:</h3>
						This rule helps you take beautiful and unique photos by using this effective rule of composition. Imagine four lines (two horizontally across the image and two vertically across the image). Now, you can do two things, center your image either in the middle of your shot, or on either side of the shot to create a more aesthetic picture. Snap the image, edits if you please, and done!
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Avoid Camera Shake:</h3>
						Make sure you know how to hold your camera correctly with both hands (one around the camera body and one around the lens). Hold the camera close to your body for support. Weather is also important to think about. If raining or windy, the camera could shake or be more unstable. Make sure you have appropriate weather conditions and correct handling of the camera.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Learn to use the Exposure Triangle (Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO):</h3>
						Understanding the relationship between Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO is very important because adjusting one of them, you most likely have to adjust the other two, or one of them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Create a Sense of Depth:</h3>
						When taking landscape photos, you want to create a sense of depth to make the viewers feel as if they were in the picture. Smaller aperture with a wide-angled lens keeps the image you want to shoot sharp! Also, having a slower shutter speed makes the photo turn out perfectly.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Use Simple Backgrounds:</h3>
						Plain, simple backgrounds tend to pop the image you want to shoot, more visible. You want your model or whatever you are shooting, in the center focus.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Try to NOT use Flash Indoors:</h3>
						When using flash, it can look harsh and unnatural for indoor portraits. Other ways you can take a photo without using the flash indoors => Put the ISO up to around 800 or 1600. The shutter speed you can choose which fits best. Make your aperture as wide as possible so more light will show (this will also give you a nice blurred background).
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Experiment with Shutter Speed:</h3>
						A faster shutter speed lets in less light and a slower shutter speed lets in more light. Using shutter speed allows you to create many different photos. Freezing motion, panning, slowing it down, and light painting! My tip to you, would be try all the kinds of shutter speed and see which one works out for you! It may get frustrating, but as you keep practicing and trying, in the end, you get the result you love.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Appreciate Your Mistakes:</h3>
						Especially with photography, there will be several mistakes. Not every photo turns out perfect. Even after many shots and trying different techniques, it still might not be what you want. Instead of being disappointed in your work, embrace it and learn from it. I know when I first started taking photos, I had so much trouble with getting pictures I loved. Even now, I would take a photo, and not love it. So, I try again, and again until I get the perfect shot that I like.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Use Your Environment:</h3>
						Go outside, use what the world has given us! Trees, flowers, plants, mountains, clouds, sun, sky, roads. Our world contains millions and millions of items and living nature that you could take photos of. From my point of view, nature photography is one of my favourites because there’s so many things you can snap pictures of. One lonely flower, couple drops of rain on each petal, surrounded by bright green grass. That shot alone, is beautiful.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Love the Photos You Take:</h3>
						Every photo you take, is unique. It’s your own creation. You found a spot, you made the adjustments to your camera and destination, and you found that certain thing you wanted to take a picture of. Not every photo will be the one, but they all show process to your photography future.
